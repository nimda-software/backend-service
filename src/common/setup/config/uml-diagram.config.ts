/**
 * UML diagram generator is using TypeORM version 0.2 (not v0.3). Since it was listed as a Peer Dependency it was not
 * possible to have two versions of TypeORM. For that reason it was aliased as 'typeorm-v2' which is using v0.2
 * under the hood but the main dependency is v0.3. It can be updated once 'typeorm-uml' supports v0.3 but meanwhile
 * its peer dependency in package-lock.json is manually altered.
 *
 *
 * That is the reason that it is required to use a separate configuration file.
